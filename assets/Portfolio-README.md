# Portfolio.

### This project aims to show and practice some of the features of CSS.

This project was mostly carried out using Flexbox to stylize the portfolio and also position it.

As requested, my portfolio was responsive, you can see that even hoover over a certain item in the portfolio it has a visual response, thus becoming more dynamic.

All available options appear to work as expected, by clicking on the options in the header, options in the main content or footer.

Unfortunately it was not possible to create responsiveness when the screen is reduced or increased, I believe it is because of the way the flexbox was assembled.
